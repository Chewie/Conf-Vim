# The philosophy of vim

## A brief history

### In the beginning: vi

        * Written by Bill Joy in 1976
        * Based on the _visual_ command of ex
        * Part of the _Single UNIX Specification_
        * Several modern vi clones exist nowadays
        * nvi, Elvis, svicc, bvi, VILE..

### Vi iMproved

        * (Arguably) the most popular clone is Vim
        * Charityware written by Bram Moolenaar in 1991
        * Almost 100% compatible with vi
        * Used as vi implementation in most Linux distributions

## Design and principles

### What vim is

        * Vim is a text editor
        * Vim excels in writing and manipulating text
        * Vim is designed to be ergonomic

### What vim is not

        * Vim is not betraying the UNIX philosophy!
        * Vim is not an IDE : no debugger or shell integration
        * The shell is just a ctrl-z away
        * See :help design-not

### A modal editor

        * Vim has 6 different modes
        * Only one of them is about inserting text
        * Most of your time will be spent in the normal mode

### Commands form a language

        * [operator][count][motion]
        * All operators work with the same motions
        * Understanding the command language makes learning easier
        * Examples: "delete a word" is daw, "copy inside quotes" is yi'

# The basics

## Moving around

### Relative movement

        * Forget arrow keys
        * Character wise: hjkl
        * word wise: web and WEB
        * Beginning and end of lines: 0, ^ and $
        * Up and down half a page: ^u and ^d
        * First and last line: gg and G

### Cursor positionning

        * Top, Middle and Bottom of the screen: HML
        * Align cursor to top, mid or bottom: zt, zz, zb

## Modifying text

### Entering insert mode

        * Entering insert mode before or after the cursor: i and a
        * At beginning or end of line: I and A
        * Next and previous line: o and O
        * Change operator leaves you in insert mode

### Three basics operators

        * Delete operator: d
        * Change operator: c
        * Copy (yank) operator: y
        * Several other operators: v,=,~,g?...

### Motions

        * Regular movement
        * Text objects: words, sentences, [] blocks...
        * Marks
        * Searches

### Text objects

        * Prefixed with a or i for "around" and "inner"
        * words and sentences: w,W,s
        * Blocks: (,[,<,{,",'
        * XML tags: t
        * b and B are shorthands for ( and {
